## PREFACE (pages xv and xvi)

### Course notes

Read the first 5 paragraphs

**phylogenetic biology**

They list several questions that phylogenetic biologists address.  Other questions (among many) include:

* What was an ancestral protein like?  (eg, a protein in an extinct organism)
* Which animal did a disease come from?
* What is the evolutionary history of a gene? A protein?
* Which genes are in a "gene family"

Note: they say on page xvi that evolutionary trees are "no linear but branching and fractal, with one beginning and many...ends."  While this is true most of the time, the phenomena of **horizontal gene transfer** (aka **lateral gene transfer**) implies that phyolgenetic **networks** can exist, at least for bacteria, and some bacterial phylogeneies may have have more than one "beginning".  This is not discussed in this book but is an important topic in bacterial phylogenetics.  For some basic information on phylogenetic networks see wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_network

## (Introduction)

**tree thinking**

## "The importance of phylogenetic trees"

**phylogenetic tree**
**phylogeny**
**traits**
**[Great Chain of Being]**

This book talks about DNA sequences and proteins but also a lot about **morphological traits**.  As will be discussed later in the book, morphological traits often have two **states**: the presence or absence of something like sexual reproduction or live birth.  **Macromolecular sequences**, however, are traits that always have at multiple different states: DNA has 4 bases, RNA has 4 bases, and there are 20 amino acids.  A molecular sequence trait could be the first DNA base after a start codon, which could be one of four bases, or the amino acid after the start codon, which is a trait with 20 different possiblities.  

## "From individuals to populations to species"

**common ancestor**

We typically think in terms of common ancestors as species. We can also think of them in terms of genes.


## "Visualizing & modeling how traits evolve"

**homologous trait**
**analogous trait**

## "Understanding what it means to be related"

**taxa**
**taxon**


## "Organizing knowledge of biological diversity"

**[biological diversity]**
