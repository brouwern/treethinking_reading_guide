Baum and Stacy D. Smiths Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology, 4th edition. More information about the book can be found at the book’s website, and it can be purchased from Amazon.com. Tree Thinking is a fabulous book for students researchers that need to understand or do basic phylogenetics and either need a concise primer on the key issues This reading guide serves several purposes: Highlight the parts of the book I focus on in my teaching (and so will be on any tests!) Indicate key vocab Provide additional complementary examples Provide citations and links to resources for follow-up Each part of the reading guide is essentially an outline of each chapter with commentary as needed. In some cases I have written a brief initial commentary to put the chapter in context. My most important notes and comments are generally in bold or bulleted. When I’ve riffed on an idea and its not necessarily key I’ve usually put in in a block quote, like the one below: For example, sometimes I’ve written about a section, and my text is almost as long as the original section! This is a work in progress and many sections are not yet annotated; feel free to contact me with suggestions or corrections. Nathan Brouwer brouwern@gmail.com "],

The term “phylogenetic” can be used as a modifier in many situations: “phylogenetic biology” is the use of phylogenetics to answer biological question, “phylogenetic analysis” is the analysis of phylogenies or their use in other analyses, a “phylogenetic question” is a question relating to the ancestry and patterns of evolution of an organism or genes, a “phylogenetic debate” is a debate about the origin or ancestry of organisms or genes.. On page xv Baum and Smith list several questions that phylogenetic biologists address. Other questions (among many) include: What was an ancestral protein like? (eg, a protein in an extinct organism) Which animal did a disease come from? What is the evolutionary history of a gene? A protein? Which genes are in a “gene family” On page xvi Baum and Smith say that evolutionary trees are “not linear but branching and fractal, with one beginning and many…ends.” While this is true for most organisms most of the time, the phenomena of horizontal gene transfer (aka lateral gene transfer) implies that phylogenetic networks can exist, at least for bacteria, and some bacterial phylogenies may have have more than one “beginning”. This is not discussed in this book but is an important topic in bacterial phylogenetics. For some basic information on phylogenetic networks see wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_network 1.3 CHAPTER 1: Phylogenetic trees &amp; their importance in modern biology 1.3.1 Course notes All sections of this chapter should be read. None of the figures in this chapter are particularly important. Note: references within this guide are not formatted correctly. 1.4 (Introduction) [tree thinking] 1.5 “The importance of phylogenetic trees” phylogenetic tree phylogeny traits [Great Chain of Being] This book talks about DNA sequences and proteins, but also a lot about morphological traits. As will be discussed later in the book, morphological traits often have two states: the presence or absence of something like sexual reproduction, a tail, or live birth. For example, most plants reproduce sexually, but some asexually, some primates have tails (monkeys) while others don’t (humans), and most mammals reproduce via live birth, but some don’t (platypus). In the case of tails, the trait is the tail, and the two states are 1: tail present, 2: tail absent. In the case of live birth in mammals, that trait is “how are offspring brough into the world” and the states are 1: from a uterus in the world via a birth canal, 2: in an egg. There can be more than two states for morphological traits, but usually we only deal with two in intro bio classes. Macromolecular sequences, however, are traits that always have at multiple different states: DNA has 4 bases, RNA has 4 bases, and there are 20 amino acids. A molecular sequence trait could be the first DNA base after a start codon, which could be one of four bases, or the amino acid after the start codon, which is a trait with 20 different possibilities. So, in the case of DNA, that trait is the position in the gene (here, bp 4, the first 3 being part of the start codon). The states are 1: A, 2: T, 3: C, 4: G. In the case of protein, the trait is the position in the amino acid is the trait, and there are 20 different states: A, T, F, … etc. THought question: if there are 100 amino acids in a polypeptide, how many traits are there? The different between a “trait” and a “state of a trait” is a common source of confusion. I’ll try to be clear about it when I discuss it. 1.6 “From individuals to populations to species” common ancestor We typically think in terms of common ancestors as species. We can also think of them in terms of genes when we look at gene families, gene duplications, orthologs and paralogs. These terms will be defined in later chapters. 1.7 “Visualizing &amp; modeling how traits evolve” homologous trait analogous trait You should be able to characterize traits - especially macromolecular traits - as either homologous or analogous. See if you can fill in the blanks here: “________, in biology, similarity of function and superficial resemblance of structures that have different origins. For example, the wings of a fly, a moth, and a bird are _______ because they developed independently as adaptations to a common function—flying.” And “______, in biology, similarity of the structure, physiology, or development of different species of organisms based upon their descent from a common evolutionary ancestor.” See the answers at https://www.britannica.com/science/homology-evolution and https://www.britannica.com/science/analogy-evolution and For definitions of homology and related terms see: http://pevsnerlab.kennedykrieger.org/wiley/appendix.htm#H For macromolecular sequences there are two types of homology: orthology and parology. These will be discussed in future chapters. 1.8 “Understanding what it means to be related” taxa taxon 1.9 “Organizing knowledge of biological diversity” [biological diversity] 1.9.1 Related references Below are references related to how phylogenetic trees can be used to organize information about biological diversity and inform further research.

PNAS 1.11 “Tree thinking and biological literacy” inference scientific inference A standard dictionary definition of inference is “a conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.” Often it involves moving from a set of particular observations to make more general conclusions about how the world works. For example, say that in a clinical trial with 100 patients, a drug reduces the risk of heart attack in by 10%. What the experiment has directly shown is only that when these 100 patients received the drug at the particular time and place the experiment was conducted, risk went down by 10%. That’s all. However, if the patients are reasonably representative of a larger population, then we can infer that most patients should improve by 10%. This is a bit of a leap of faith and requires a lot of assumptions, but frequently science operates with limited times frames and budgets, and so we have to make inference based on the usually limited data at hand. An example I like to use for inference is from a recent archaeology paper (Radini et al 2019, Science Advances). Archaeology, paleontology, geology, phylogenetics, and much of evolutionary biology rely heavily on inference because they work on phenomena from the past which cannot be observed. Based on available artifacts - bones, DNA sequences, rocks - these scientists can infer what happened. Radini et al (2019) were studying bones from the middle ages. They found a unique mineral, lapiz lazuli, stuck in the plaque on the teeth of a woman’s skull. Lapiz lazuli is a rare mineral used in medieval artwork, particularly the ornately drawn parts of books. Scribes and artists were usually assumed to be men (monks). But since Radini et al (2019) found a mineral used in artwork in the teeth of a woman, they can infer that she was an artist, because artists frequently wet their paint brushes in their mouths, creating the opportunity to get stuck to their teeth. Radini et al. obviously have no direct observations of this woman painting illuminated manuscripts, and know very little about her except what they can tell from her bones. Buts its a highly logical step to take that this woman was an artists; that is, its a reasonable inference. Computational biology, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics all rely heavily on inference for many tasks. If two DNA sequences align over much of their length, we can infer they share an evolutionary history. The more overlap, the stronger the inference. There isn’t direct evidence of that history, but lacking other evidence its a reasonable inference to make that the sequences are related. The alternative is that mutation and evolution happened to create two seperate sequences that were very similar. This is possible, but requires more steps so seems less plausible. A frequent feature of inference is parsimony: simpler explanations based only on data are better than complex explanations that involve more assumptions, guesswork, or chance occurrences. New data might eventually support more complex explanations, but until then, simpler is better. There is actually a whole approach to building phylogenetic trees based on parsimony which will occupy a future chapter. "],

The paper and figures are in seperate files and can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=117qDPPLBhWrpi596LQMoVgCkNZQX5nye 3.1 Notes Key vocabulary are in bold below. Vocabulary that is good to be familiar with but is not essential is in in brackets [ ] There are several sections of this chapter that can be skipped. 3.2 Objectives After reading this chapter you should Understand how to interpret ancestor-descendant relationships on a tree Know when two trees have the same topology, even if they are drawn differently Know the names of the major features of trees (root, branch, tips, etc) Know how to identify clades on a tree Know that a tree is just an estimate of the true evolutionary history, and so we need to represent uncertainty in our estimate (Eg with bootstrapping) 3.3 (Introduction) 3.4 “Continuity of reproduction from the population to the tree of life” tips (of phylogenetic tree): know how to identify the tips, where they are, what they are for a given tree lineage splitting [pedigree] [cladogenesis] [allopatric divergence] [sympatric divergence] Figure2 3.1 to 3.5: These figures are useful conceptually but you won’t need to interpret figures like these Figure 3.6: You need to know that the orientation of the tree (up or down) doesn’t matter Figure 3.7: You need to know that these two ways of drawing a tree are equivalent. 3.5 “Asexual organisms” Read this briefly; its interesting but not key. 3.6 “Tree terminology and conventions” This stuff is really important. There likely will be a few basic questions on the test related to labeling or identifying the parts of the tree. branches (of phylogenetic tree): You should know what branches are, how they are drawn, and what differences in branch lengths mean. You should also know the different styles of drawing branches and be able to interpret them. edges (of phylogenetic tree): I will mostly likely not use the term “edges”, but it does appear in the literature and is the formal name used by math folks. If/when we talk about networks the term edges will become more important. directed (graph or tree): The terms directed and acyclic aren’t very important to understanding phylogenetic trees, but these terms will also come back if/when we talk about networks. Phylogenetic trees are directed because they represent a historical process and the passage of time. acyclic (graph or tree) tips: You should know what tips are and how they are drawn. I will call the ends of the tree “tips”, thought you may encounter other terms in other sources. [leaves] **[terminals**] root: You should know where the root of a tree is, or if a tree lacks a root and is unrooted (discussed later in chapter) Nodes: You should know where nodes are on a tree and know what they represent. You should also know how the placement of nodes relates to branch lengths. lineage splitting event: lineage splitting event result in genetic divergence. [internal branches] [internodes] [external branches]: This term occurs in the literature but I will usually just refer generically to branches. clade: You should be able to identify clades, be able to tell if a given set of tips for a clade, etc. monophyly: You should now whether a group is monophyletic or not. sister group: For a given tip, you should be able to identify its sister taxa. sister taxa Figure 3.9 is a very good figure for understanding tree terminology. Tips, root, and branches are the most important terms. Figure 3.10 is a classic illustration of a monophyletic groups versus a non-monphyletic group. Similar figures can also be found on the internet, eg Wikipedia. 3.7 “Tree topology” branching order (of phylogenetic tree) topology (of phylogenetic tree): You should be able to determine if two trees have the same topology or not Figure 3.11 is important for understanding how trees can be rotated without impacting their topology. Note: I do not (currently) use the “splits” format referred to on page 46. 3.8 “Different tree styles” Goal: You should be able to interpret trees in all their shapes and formats. Circle trees are becoming increasinly common because they allow compact presentation of lots of data. [diagonal phylogenetic tree] [rectangular phylogenetic tree] [circle phylogenetic tree] Figure 3.15 is important for seeing how different shapes and formats of trees can all have the same topology. The following trees use bird order as the taxa on the tips of the tree. These naems are long so I removed the “iformes” that occurs at the end of each name. A standard diagonal tree. plot(bird.orders, type = &quot;c&quot;, use.edge.length = F) A standard rectangular tree. Struthioniformes are at the bottom: Can you tell what the sister group to the Struthioniformes is? Do Struthioniformes, Tinamiformes, and Craciformes make up a clade? How aboutthose three orders PLUS Galliformes and Anseriformes? What about those five orders plut Turniciformes? The exact same tree, pointed the other direction. plot(bird.orders, type = &quot;p&quot;, direction = &quot;l&quot;,, use.edge.length = F) A circle tree representation. All of these trees have different systles but they have the same branching order and therefore the same tology. plot(bird.orders, type = &quot;f&quot;, cex = 0.9,use.edge.length = F) 3.9 “Merging and pruning” (SKIP) This section can be skipped for now, but will be assigned later. pruning (a phylogenetic tree) merging (a phylogeneitc tree) The concept of merging will become relevant when we talk about “distance-based” methods of phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Merging is involved in the algorithm for building these types of trees. 3.10 “The time axis” (SKIP) This section can be skipped for now, but will be assigned later. chronogram: you’ll need to know what the added feature of a chronogram is versus a regular cladogram cladogram Fossils are very important for establishing dates. We won’t spend much time talking about fossils; instead, we will talk about the use of molecular clock methods. These methods, however, have important limitations. The best way to add dates to tree is to use fossils. 3.10.1 Related papers Quental and Marshall. 2010. Diversity dynamics: molecular phylogenies need the fossil record. Trends in Ecology and Evolution. 3.11 “Branch lengths &amp; evolutionary rate” (SKIP) branch lengths (of phylogenetic tree): You will need to know what branch lengths represent; eventually you’ll learn how they are calcualted, but that will be a while. [phylograms] Branch lengths and how they are estimated will be a very important consideration when we begin building phylogenies using mathematical models such as distance-based methods and maximum likelihood. In contrast, the parsimony methods some people learn in intro biology and evolution classes preclude consideration of branch lengths. 3.12 “Communicating phylogenetic uncertainty” (SKIP) This section can be skipped for now, but will be assigned later. [binary tree] [ancestral lineage] [descendant lineage] dichotomous tree [fully resolved phylogenetic tree] polytomy: You will need to know a polytomy when one occurs in a tree and what aspects of the data or analysis cause it to be there. We will ge into the details later. [hard polytomy] [soft polytomy] consensus tree: I hope to discuss how consensus trees are built but we’ll see how things go. If you see one in a paper you need to know how it is different from a regular tree, or what its a “consensus” of. [input tree] strict consensus tree 3.12.1 “Consensus trees” (SKIP) This section can be skipped for now, but will be assigned later. The section on consensus trees is important for being able to interpret published trees. Looking at a tree you should be able to identify if there are polytomies, know what they imply, and determine from information in the paper why it is there. If time allows we will discuss how consensus trees are built; several key types of algorithms and computational techniques are used to build them (Sul and Williams 2011). 3.12.2 Related papers Sul and Williams. 2011.

Homoplasy in genome-wide analysis of rare amino acid replacements: the molecular-evolutionary basis for Vavilov’s law of homologous series Figure 4.5 is a very important figure to understand. Figure 4.6 shows that the basic idea of homology isn’t that complicated. NOte that the “Spur” is the little grey thingy sticking off the bottomo f the flower. FIgure 4.7 shows convergence. It might help to draw a line on the branches where the trait of spurs evolved in each linneage. Since spurs developed seperately in each clade, they are not homologous. Figure 4.8 might be a little confusing. Key to understanding it is to note that that the clade which “D” is part of lost the spur trait. Spurs then evolved again in D. The spurs in D are not homologous to the other spurs because they have separate evolutionary origins. Homology is a key topic in phylogenetics and we will revisit. Note: Sometimes you will see people refer to “percent homology” in reference to sequences (Inkpen and Doolittle 2016). Homology is a binary condition; a gene or a trait in two organism can either be traced back to a common ancestory and are homologous or are not. THere is therefore no partial homology. 4.6.2 Further reading Inkpen and Doolittle 2016. Molecular Phylogenetics and the Perennial Problem of Homology.

Cross reference this with the concept of pseudo genes. gene copy extinction: skip whole genome duplication: need to know what this is, but we aren’t concerned with the mechanisms. Need to know that this creates duplicate copies of all genes in the genome, which evolution can then act on in interesting ways. Cross reference this with the concept of pseudo genes. polyploidy: genomes larger than 2n; usually in plants but can occur in various species. Need to know what this is but we aren’t concerned with the mechanisms polyploid: an organism with a genome larger than 2n. 2n: diploid organism whose gametes contain a single copy of the genome segemental duplication: I don’t use this term gene families: important concept. Many books talk about the globin gene family (hemoglobin, myoglobin). Shroom is a gene family. diverged function gene trees: phylogenetic tree focused on the history of and relationship between genes, not necessarily species. If misinterpreted gene trees can appear to present an incorrect species phylogeny. haploid genome: 1n; exists in gametes ancestral population diploid: 2n; exists in somatic cells. There are two copies of each gene, there fore two alleles, thought they are possibly the same allele lineage splitting: normally we think about lineage splitting in terms of a literal population being split, like a population of monkey which gets split into two populations by the formation of a new river that cuts through their habitat, or when members of a population disperse to a new location like an island. When a lineage gets split, gene flow is typically reduced or becomes zero, which creates the opportunity for genetic divergence and possibly even speciation. The process of a gene getting duplicated is analogous, though the idea of a population doesn’t translate. What does happen is that duplication is typically followed by divergence in the sequence of the two copies of the gene as different random mutations occur. If mutations result in altered function then natural selection can begin to act and drive further divergence. fixed more recent common ancestor: the concept of the ancestor of an individual can be extended to the ancestral state or species of a current species. Similarly, there is an ancestral state (sequence) or ancestor of a current gene. population lineage split (pg 152): this phrase is a bit awkward. What their saying here is: image a gene duplicates within the genome of a species. That duplication starts of in one individual, then spreads, then eventually becomes fixed so that all individuals in the species have two copies of then gene. Then, something splits up the population into two populations, setting the stage for speciation. Figure 6.9 is important to understand Figure 6.10 is important homologs: very important concept. Contrast with analog. There are two types of homologs: paralogs and orthologs ortholog / orthologous gene: a type of homolog that results due to speciation / population splitting events. Orthologs can be used to build species trees. paralog / paralogous gene: a type of homolog that results due to gene duplication within a species. “Para” means “along side”, so two paralogs are genes that exist along side each other within the same genome. Paralogs can be problematic for constructing species trees. Wikipedia has a pretty good section on sequence homology and paralogs versus orthologs, using histone genes as an example. Humans and chimps both have two histone H1 genes: H1.1 and H1.2. Baum and Smith note that “the identification of orthologs is often an important step in functional genetic studies” (pg 154). Molecular biologists often to know what parts of a protein are most concerned because these are likely to be important in function. Orthologs occurring in two different species are likely to have similar functions. Comparing orthologs and looking for parts of the sequences that haven’t changed provide clues to where important functional sites might be. In contrast, paralogs often diverge in their function. This is most obvious within an organism. When doing comparisons across species there is a risk of comparisons between paralogs that have diverged function. 5.2 Further reading There’s a short article about orthologs versus paralogs at sciencing.com Bitesizebio.com also has short article. 5.3 Chapter quiz 5.3.1 Intro bio 5.3.2 Computational biology "],
